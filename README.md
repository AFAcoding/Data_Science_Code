# **Data Science Sandbox**

This repository is a collection of diverse projects I developed while learning and experimenting with various data science tools and techniques. Each project represents a step in my journey, where I explored different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Throughout these exercises, I worked with real-world datasets, applied exploratory data analysis, performed feature engineering, trained models, and evaluated their performance.  

My goal with this repository is to document my progress, solidify my understanding of key concepts, and build a practical foundation in data science. Along the way, I have utilized essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn, among others. These projects are not just theoretical exercises but practical applications of what I have learned, helping me gain hands-on experience in solving data-driven problems.  

This repository serves as both a personal learning archive and a resource for anyone interested in seeing real implementations of various data science techniques. Whether you are looking for inspiration, references, or insights into different data science methodologies, feel free to explore and engage with the work shared here. I welcome any feedback, discussions, or contributions that can help enhance these learning experiences.
